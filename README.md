# EE-5103-Engineering-Programming
All assignments require me to use the current circulium of code. 
The only code I'm allowed to use is what is currently taught in the lectures.
Each assignment needs to be done with the knowledge taught in the lectures leading to it.
As the course progresses the HW assignments will involve more advance C++ knowledge.
